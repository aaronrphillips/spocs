This document describes the generic installation procedure for SPOCS.

Before starting the build/install procedure we recommend you read all
the installation instructions before you proceed. You may need root
or sudo privileges to install the prerequisites and/or the SPOCS software.


The installation procedure:
  1. Prerequisites
  2. Download SPOCS
  3. Configure
  4. Build
  5. Test
  6. Install


1. Prerequisites:

   a. C++ compiler

      This software has only been built and tested on Linux RHEL 5 and
      MacOS X with g++ from gnu.org. Your version of g++ should work as
      long as it is newer than 4.1.

      For Linux you will need the rpm/yum package gcc-c++.
      For MacOS you will need to install Xcode and do the following:
        - Start Xcode
        - Go to the menu Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads and install the
          "Command line tools"

   b. Boost C++ Libraries

      You will need the Boost C++ Libraries from https://www.boost.org.
      This software has only been built and tested with versions of boost
      newer than 1.49-0 but should work with anything newer than 1.33-0.

      If you don't have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system
      you can follow the instructions below to install the libraries.

      For Linux:
        - There is a script, support/boost_install_script.sh, that you
          can run that will install the Boost libraries in /usr/local
          of you can modify it to suite your needs.

      For MacOS:
        - see http://www.macports.org
        - sudo port install boost

   c. NCBI Blast version 2.2.22 or newer from nih.gov

      For Linux:
        - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.22/blast-2.2.22-x64-linux.tar.gz

      For MacOS:
        - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.22/blast-2.2.22-universal-macosx.tar.gz

      NOTE: You must add the directory to your PATH where blastall and formatdb
            are installed (e.g. /usr/local/bin).


2. Download SPOCS

   More than likely you have already done this to read this file or
   you are reading it online.

   a. Download the latest version of SPOCS from:
      http://cbb.pnnl.gov/tools/spocs.html

   b. Assuming the file you downloaded is called spocs-M_m_u.tar.gz
      where M_m_u is the Major, minor, and micro version of the software.
      tar zxf spocs-M_m_u.tar.gz
      cd spocs-M_m_u


3. Configure:

   a. You must have blastall and formatdb in your PATH.
   b. You must have the path to where the boost headers and libraries are
      installed
      - e.g. For Linux: /usr/local/boost_1_53_0_static64_release_multi
      - e.g. For MacOS: /opt/boost-1.50

   c. Type the command:
      ./configure --with-boost=/path_to_boost
      For Linux:
        ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/boost_1_53_0_static64_release_multi
      For MacOS:
        ./configure --with-boost=/opt/boost-1.50

      NOTE: If you do not supply the --prefix option, the SPOCS binary
            will try to install itself in /usr/local/bin

   d. If everything is correct you should not get any errors. If you get
      output that has errors, then you more than likely do not have
      blastall in your path or do not have boost installed correctly or
      are trying this on a different platform that has not been tested.
      If the problem is a new platform and you get it to work, please
      send your fix to the AUTHORS.


4. Build

   a. Type the command:
      make
      NOTE: If you have multiple cores and GNU make, you can type:
      make -j N
      where N is the number of cores you have.

   b. If everything is correct you should not get any errors. If you get
      output that has errors, then you more than likely trying this on a
      different platform that has not been tested. If the problem is a
      new platform and you get it to work, please send your fix to the
      AUTHORS.


5. Test

   a. Type the command:
      make check

   b. If everything is correct you should get output similar to:

Making check in src
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `check'.
make  check-TESTS

   c. If you get output that has errors, then you more than likely trying
      this on a different platform that has not been tested. If the
      problem is a new platform and you get it to work, please send your
      fix to the AUTHORS.

      For MacOS: If you get the following errors:

Making check in src
make  check-TESTS
dyld: Library not loaded: libboost_program_options.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/d3c572/Downloads/spocs-1_0_7/src/spocs

make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1

      Then you will need to set the environment variable,
      DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH to include the boost libraries.
      For example in bash you will need to type the following:
        export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/boost-1.50/lib:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
      and then try and run make check again.

   d. You can open the file, data/output/gold4_cliques/index.html, in your
      Chrome or Firefox browser to view the data.


6. Install

   a. Type the command:
      make install

      NOTE: This will install the spocs binary in /usr/local/bin or 
            the directory you specified with the --prefix option when
            you ran the ./configure command in step 3 above.

   b. If you get output errors, they are probably because you do not have
      permissions to install the software.

If you make it to this point, then you have successfully installed the
SPOCS software and are ready to start exploring your own data sets.
