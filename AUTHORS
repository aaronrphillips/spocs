Special thanks to the following people for writing software or papers
that we based our software on:

Sean Conlan, from the Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National
Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892. Sean worked
with Lee Ann McCue to extend the ideas of finding orthologs and paralogs
to work with many species and find a single maximal clique in a graph.

This software extends previous proof of concept efforts represented
in the paper:
     Callister, S.J., et al. (2008) Comparative bacterial proteomics:
        analysis of the core genome concept, PloS one, 3, e1542.

The Ortholog and Paralog finders are based on the concepts in the paper:
     Remm, M., Storm, C.E. and Sonnhammer, E.L. (2001) Automatic
        clustering of orthologs and in-paralogs from pairwise species
        comparisons, Journal of molecular biology, 314, 1041-1052.

The Solver.cpp is a C++ graph solver which finds ALL cliques in a graph
and is primarily based on an older C version of the "Maximum Clique
Algorithm" that can be found at:
http://www.sicmm.org/~konc/maxclique/maxcliquedyn.cc
and the paper:
     Janez Konc and Dusanka Janezic. An improved branch and bound
        algorithm for the maximum clique problem. MATCH Commun. Math.
        Comput. Chem., 2007, 58, 569-590.
